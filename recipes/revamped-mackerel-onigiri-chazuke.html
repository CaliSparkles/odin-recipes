        <h2>A dish so good it will transport you to the ocean!</h2>
        <p>This dish was revamped by S≈çma Yukihira to include mackerel instead of the traditional salmon. This dish also uses kelp tea instead of green tea.</p>
        <p>This dish was created by <a href="https://onionchoppingninja.tumblr.com/post/147915693138/mackerel-onigiri-chazuke-from-shokugeki-no-souma">@onionchoppingninja</a> </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 mackerel fillet</li>
            <li>Lots of olive oil</li>
            <li>Salted Kelp Tea</li>
            <li>1 cup rice</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>To garnish: Salted kelp</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Cook rice in rice cooker.</li> 
           <li>Pat mackerel dry and sprinkle with salt to cure for at least 20 minutes. (I cured it specially from a few days before - removing moisture makes the fish crispier and meatier)</li> 
           <li>Heat some oil in a pan.</li> 
           <li>Cut mackerel into smaller pieces (I thought this might make the mackerel less messy)</li> 
           <li>Poele the mackerel until crispy!</li> 
           <li>Make the onigiri by shaping it around the fish with cling wrap</li> 
           <li>Boil water and make the salted kelp tea</li> 
           <li>Garnish and serve in a bowl with the kelp tea</li> 
           <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

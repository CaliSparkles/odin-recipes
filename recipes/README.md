The Odin Project recipe project.

This is a basic html page featuring recipes from Food Wars. 

This webpage was created to demonstrate the skills I have learned in The Odin Project up to this point. Which are as follows: Inserting an image, adding the alt attribute to images for screen readers, creating a basic HTML boilerplate, creating lists, adding links, and emphasizing words with the <em> and <strong> tags.
